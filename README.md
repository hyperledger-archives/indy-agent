Indy Agents
===========

Migration Notice
----------------

**The work of creating interoperable Agents has moved to the Hyperledger Aries Project.** Much of the code and
information in this repository remains relevant as a reference point; however, this information is not as actively kept
up to date and **may be incorrect**. For the up-to-date counterparts of the components in this repository, refer to the
list below.

#### Superseding Projects
- Docs and Protocol: [Indy HIPE][1] for Indy specific documentation, [Aries RFCs][2] for everything else.
- Python Reference Agent: [Aries Cloud Agent Python][3]
- Agent Test Suite: [Aries Protocol Test Suite][4]
- Node.js Agent: No codebase yet exists that directly supersedes this project. However, discussion around creating a
	Node.js Agent Framework are being held in the Aries Community. Direct questions about these efforts to the
	[Hyperledger Rocket.Chat Aries channel][5].

Agents
------

Agents come in all varieties. Some are simple and static; these
might be appropriate for IoT use cases that are hard-wired for
a single connection. Others are complex and cloud-based, suitable
for enterprise use. Still others run on mobile devices for
individual users. For more information about general agent theory
or about agent categories, see the [Agents Explainer HIPE](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe/blob/4696f162/text/0002-agents/README.md).

This repo contains a handful of reference agents. To run them,
you must have a build of libindy plus a running ledger.  If you
are just trying them out, we recommend [running a ledger locally
using docker](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk/blob/master/docs/build-guides/ubuntu-build.md).
See the README in each implementation directory for more
details.

The repo also has some useful tools for agent developers--especially
a test suite that can exercise agent interoperability.
